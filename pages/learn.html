                            <h1>Nutrition</h1> 
                            <p>Ah nutrition, American is pretty well known for their obesity and this is due to poor nutrition with all the fast foods we have available. There are surprisingly a lot of people who will join a gym, start exercise with the intention of losing weight, or gaining muscle weight and expect to see results without a proper diet plan. One of the most important gym rules is the 80-20 rule. This rule is the kitchen to gym ratio rule. What this means is that the results you will see are 80% of the work you put into the food you eat (kitchen) and 20% of the amount of work you put into exercising (gym). An important part of your nutrition plan should be the number of calories that you consume as well as setting your meals at reasonable times. Depending on what you wanna do should set the number of calories you consume. If you are trying to lose weight you should consume less calories than you burn off. On the other hand if you are trying to gain muscle weight you should consume more calories than you burn off. Another important part of gaining muscle weight is eating tons of protein (chicken/eggs etc…). The overall lesson here should be is that what you eat is what matters the most when working on fitness. </p>

                            <h1>Flexibility</h1> 
                            <p>Before a workout it is always good to stretch. This can be the old fashioned, simple stretches or you can take it to the next level to really prepare for your workout and practice some yoga right before your workout. Stretching can help avoid injuries. If you’re working out in the cold make sure you warm up before stretching to avoid injuries. Some good yoga poses that will help you stretch are downward facing dog, the bridge, the plank and the mountain. So remember guys, before any type of exercise make you stretch Flexibility is key!</p>

                            <h1>Cardio</h1> 
                            <p>Cardio is a must for anybody who wants to lose weight. Touching back on the nutrition part, it helps burn a lot of cardio. Anaerobic and aerobic exercises are important here. Anaerobic exercises are short-lasting, high-intensity activity, where your body's demand for oxygen exceeds the oxygen supply available. Aerobic exercises are any of various sustained exercises that stimulate and strengthen the heart and lungs, thereby improving the body's utilization of oxygen. Cardio has both anaerobic and aerobic exercises. An example of anaerobic exercises in cardio intense sprinting. An example of aerobic exercise is jogging for long distances as well as cycling. So remember anaerobic exercises are with little oxygen inhaled for the workout and aerobic exercises are with a lot of oxygen inhaled for the workout.</p>

                            <h1>Weight Training</h1> 
                            <p>Ah weight training. This is what all the skinny teenagers that come to the gym wanna do so that they can “get big”. However there are many misconceptions when it comes to weight training that gets people hurt or they simply see no results. Many people give tips like “lift a lot of light weights, it’ll be enough”, this is false. To get the maximum amount of muscle you have to lift heavy to work your muscle the hardest. Another common thing is that people skip “leg day”. This is a mystery as legs are the BIGGEST MUSCLE in the body. So why would you not work them? Make sure you rest between sets! The amount of time that you rest between sets is dependent upon the intensity at which you lift (how close to your maximum). If you are doing higher reps (12-15) then you rest periods will be shorter (45-75 seconds), but if you are doing only a few reps (1-5) then you will need longer periods (2-5minutes) between each set. I know it sounds backward, but it has to do with energy. The more reps you do the lighter the weight and the faster your body will bounce back for the next set. The heavier the weight lifted the longer it takes to recover the energy for another bout of the same movement.</p>

                            <h1>Recovery Time</h1> 
                            <p>It may take a while for someone who just starts to go to the gym to realize just how important recovery time is. Most people realize how important recovery time is when they suffer an injury, or when the see a lack of results. Furthermore, yes, recovery time is one of the most important things when it comes to exercising How long should your recovery time be you might ask. The recommended time for recovery is one to two days after working out the specific body part. So let’s say you work arms on Monday, you should wait until Wednesday to work on arms again. The lesson form this should be, never work on the same body part the same day, nor the day after. YOU WILL NOT SEE RESULTS, AND EVEN WORST YOU COULD GET SEVERELY INJURED.</p>
